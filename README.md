If you wish to use any material in this repository please be aware that this code was tailored to the analyses conducted in the above manuscript and it is presented here to foster reproducibility. **The code is not intended to be used in other contexts**. Hence, use it at your own risk.

 The scripts are divided in 3 folders, containing the code for the analyses performed for the taxonomy, functional profiles, and metabolomics data. Scripts are numbered and have been executed sequentially.

## Work-flow
### Taxonomy
01 – Load data, format the metadata and perform alpha and beta diversity analyses

02 – Filter the data to perform differential abundance analysis at the species level

03 – Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models performed at the species level

04 - Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models performed at the species level to compare mice groups at the beginning of the experiment

05 – Filter the data to perform differential abundance analysis at the family level

06 – Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models performed at the family level

07- Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models performed at the family level to compare mice groups at the beginning of the experiment

### Functions

01 – Load the data and format them

02 – Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models

03 – Differential abundance analysis based on linear mixed models performed to compare mice groups at the beginning of the experiment

### Metabolomics

01 – Load data, format and transform them

02 – Perform ordinations and PLS-DA
